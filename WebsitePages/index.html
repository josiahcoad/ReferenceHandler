                            BACKGROUND: Skin autofluorescence is a non-invasive measurement of advanced glycation end products (AGE), which are suggested to be one of the major agents in the pathogenesis and progression of diabetes related cardiovascular complications. Recently, low vitamin D status has been linked to the progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study is to investigate the association between vitamin D status and skin autofluorescence in patients with T2DM.
                            METHODS: In this preliminary report skin autofluorescence was measured non-invasively with an AGE-reader in 245 patients with T2DM treated with lifestyle advice, metformin and/or sulphonylurea-derivatives. All patients were randomly assigned to receive either vitamin D 50,000 IU/month or placebo for 6 months.
                            RESULTS: Skin autofluorescence was significantly higher in patients with a serum 25(OH)D < 50 nmol/l compared to patients with a serum 25(OH)D > 75 nmol/l (2.81 versus 2.41; p < 0.001). Mean serum 25(OH)D was 60.3 +/- 23.4 nmol/l and was independently associated with skin autofluorescence (beta -0.006; p < 0.001). Mean vitamin D increased from 60.8 to 103.6 nmol/l in the intervention group, however no effect was seen on accumulation of skin AGEs after 6 months compared to placebo.
                            CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D status is independently associated with skin auto fluorescence in patients with well-controlled T2DM. No effect was seen on the amount of skin AGEs after a short period of 6 months vitamin D supplementation. Further research with longer follow-up and measurement of circulating advanced glycation end products is needed to elucidate the causality of the association.

                            BACKGROUND: Besides the classical role of vitamin D on calcium and bone homeostasis, vitamin D deficiency has recently been identified as a contributing factor in the onset of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, it is uncertain whether vitamin D deficiency and poor glycaemic control are causally interrelated or that they constitute two independent features of type 2 diabetes mellitus. There are limited clinical trials carried out which measured the effect of vitamin D supplementation on glycaemic control.The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on glycaemic control and quality of life in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
                            METHODS/DESIGN: In a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial conducted in five general practices in the Netherlands three hundred patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with lifestyle advises or metformin or sulphonylurea-derivatives are randomised to receive either placebo or 50,000 IU Vitamin D3 at monthly intervals. The primary outcome measure is the change in glycated haemoglobin level between baseline and six months. Secondary outcome measures include blood pressure, anthropometric parameters, lipid profile, insulin resistance, quality of life, advanced glycation end products and safety profiles. Quality of life will be measured by The Short Form (SF-36) Health Survey questionnaire. Advanced glycation end products are measured by an AGE-reader.
                            DISCUSSION: This trial will be the first study exploring the effect of vitamin D supplementation on both glycaemic control and quality of life in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Our findings will contribute to the knowledge of the relationship between vitamin D status and insulin resistance in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

                            <div id="abstract3" class="collapse">Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have impaired ketogenesis due to high serum insulin and low growth hormone levels. Evidence exists that ketone bodies might improve kidney and cardiac function. In theory, improved ketogenesis in diabetics may have positive effects. We aimed to assess the impact of diabetic ketosis on all-cause mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus presenting with hyperglycemic crisis. We analyzed 486 patients with diabetic ketosis and 486 age and sex-matched patients with non-ketotic hyperglycemia presenting to the emergency department. Cox proportional hazard models were used to analyze the link between patient characteristics and mortality. During an observation time of 33.4 months, death of any cause occurred in 40.9% of the non-ketotic hyperglycemia group and 30.2% of the DK group (hazard ratio in the diabetic ketosis group, 0.63; 95% confidence interval 0.48-0.82; P=0.0005). Patients with diabetic ketosis had a lower incidence of symptomatic heart failure and had improved renal function. They used less furosemide and antihypertensive drugs, more metformin and lower insulin doses, all of which was independently associated with decreased mortality. Plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels were similar in both groups. Patients with hyperglycemic crisis and diabetic ketosis have decreased all-cause mortality when compared to those with non-ketotic hyperglycemia. diabetic ketosis might be a compensatory mechanism rather than a complication in patients with hyperglycemic crises, but further prospective studies are warranted.
