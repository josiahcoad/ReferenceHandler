" Whats the secret to success? I agree with Dorothy Parker when I say it's to be passionately curious. I love to invent, discover and lead. When I was 17, I made my car voice controlled while also being the Student Body President of my high school. When I was 18, I started and led an underwater robotics team of over 40 students that competed in an international NASA competition while also being the Engineering Representative and coordinating the largest two student events on campus. At age 19, I received my first patent for geometrical algorithms that I had implemented for a revolutionary 3D printing technique. And at age 20, I co-authored my first paper that would be published on sketch-recognition algorithms with a team of graduate students. Now, as a Junior at age 21, I am studying abroad at Oxford and maintaining a 3.9 in honors college in Computer Science and Statistics at Texas A&M. After a summer as a Software Engineering Intern at Microsoft, I am looking for a challenging and interdisciplinary internship that would enable me to use both my technical and interpersonal skills to solve complex problems. One of my advantages lies in the math and statistics that I have combined with my computer science degree that have helped make me a highly analytical thinker, while at the same time having the interpersonal skills to bring people together and be a leader for innovation."
